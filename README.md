For presenting technical specifications and instructions:
Screenshots: Capture images of software interfaces or hardware setups to provide visual guidance.
## 9. How do headings and subheadings improve the readability and organization of technical documents?
Headings and subheadings significantly enhance the readability and organization of technical documents.
 They break down complex information into smaller, digestible chunks, making it easier for readers to skim and locate specific information.
